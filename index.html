  <p>Hello! My name is Avery Pham.</p>
  <p>I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC San Diego studying Mathematics-Computer Science.
     My professional interest is mainly in software engineering but quantitative finance and data science also 
     seem interesting.</p>  
  <p>My hobbies have changed a lot over time but I've always loved cars and motorcycles as well as tech. In the past I used to
    swim and play water polo. I don't play or follow much sports now but I do try and stay active and healthy. </p>
  <p>Feel free to check out my LinkedIn and/or GitHub. I've also added a link to my e-mail if 
    you ever want to reach out.</p>
